STEPS TO INSTALL THE POLSOLVE AND POLSIMULATE TASKS INTO CASA 6.x


###################################
### FIRST: GET THE SOFTWARE!

0. Download and install CASA. Just go to:

   https://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml

   and follow the instructions. 



1.- Download and untar the CASA-poltools. These are in:

     https://github.com/marti-vidal-i/casa-poltools

   Put the CASA-poltools into a directory. Let us assume, from
   now on, that the poltools are located in the directory
 
    POLTOOLSPATH=/home/you/.casa/PolTools

##############################################



###################################
### SECOND: COMPILE THE SOFTWARE!


2.- If it exists, delete any file with an *.so extension
    from the directory $POLTOOLSPATH.


    
3.- Compile the C++ modules.

   3.1.- First, install the needed libraries. 
         THIS STEP MAY NOT BE NEEDED (WHO KNOWS!)

     For instance, in Debian, run in a terminal (as root):

     apt-get install python-dev

     or, in Mac OS:
 
     brew reinstall python


   3.2.- Get the path where CASA is installed.
         Just execute CASA and get the output of this:

         import os
         os.environ.get('CASAPATH').split()[0]

     Let us call this output "CASABASE".
   

   3.3.- Now, run a terminal, go to the path where 
         you have the PolTools and compile them:

    -- IF USING GNU/Linux:

      cd $POLTOOLSPATH
      $CASABASE/bin/python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

    -- IF USING MACOS:

      cd $POLTOOLSPATH
      $CASABASE/MacOS/python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace


   where "$CASABASE" is the path to your CASA installation.
   (remember that we got it in step 3.2).



4.- Configure CASA to load the tasks:

   4.1.- Edit your startup script, which is:

        /home/you/.casa/config.py

   The script should have the following lines in it:

-------------------------
import sys

# This should be the path where you have the poltools:
POLTOOLSPATH = '/home/you/.casa/PolTools'
sys.path.append(POLTOOLSPATH)

-------------------------


       
5.- That's it! You should be able to run the poltools in CASA!
    These are loaded as functions (i.e., no tasks anymore).
    The modules should be loaded by running:

from task_polsolve import polsolve
from task_polsimulate import polsimulate
from task_CCextract import CCextract
from poltools_helper import plotPolImage
from poltools_helper import plotPolTraces


To get some help text about the three tools, just execute 
either of:

polsolve()

polsimulate()

CCextract()
